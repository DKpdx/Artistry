Today, I worked on the authentication with my team. I pushed what I worked on over the weekend to my authentication-trial branch and Danny helped debug it with John to get the create-account working, once that was done, we were able to create, login and logout. Tonight and tomorrow I will work on other account endpoints like get_one, update_account, and delete_account.

Today we had to revisit the schema and wire frame to talk about implementing a new Like feature. We spent most of the day planning and reworking our ubiquitous language, and planning.

Today we worked as a group to implement the new feature for the backend endpoints. We had to update the arts schema to include a user_id to link the user to the art. We also added a create like feature, a get_all_likes feature, a get_one_like feature, and a delete_like feature. We're hoping tha these are sufficient in covering our backend requirements so we can move on to front end authentication and development.

Today I Partner Programmed with the group while Danny, Heather, and John worked on the likes backend features. We got them working and protected on the FastAPI side.

I know we're technically on a break but I worked on the MainPage for the website today. We have a Navbar and a categories filter. Figuring out how to connect those features to the database will be fun.

I worked on the the art cards for the MainPage, I have a working demo but nothing is connected to the backend. I think I will also need to implement a new Locations Table for users to sign up because we currently only take a zipcode, but I think we may need to use a database of cities and states instead.

I'm working on adding tailwind to our stack so we can make the front-end look better than I could with basic CSS. We still have a lot features to add. As for the likes page, I think we might be able to use the categories feature on the MainPage as a way to filter a user's liked art. So instead of making a whole new page, we can just filter what they liked on the one page. I'm going to actually take some days for a break and get back to adjusting things over the weekend.

Today the Instructors suggested we at least start the idea of deploying our app. I drove code while the others supervised. We were able to complete step 1 really fast and then we got stuck on steps 2-3.

April 18, 2023

Today we continued to try and work on the deployment, we reviewed the code entered and made some changes, so now we think steps 2-3 are complete but we have no way of knowing because we are still facing difficulties on the gitlab side.

April 19, 2023

Today we took a break from deployment and tried to get some frontend work done. I changed some things for our main page and partner-programmed with Peter to help with the CreateArtForm.js debugging. Today was pretty productive until the update account form debugging, which stopped our momentum for the day.

April 20, 2023

We still have so much to do.

April 24, 2023

Today we worked as a unit to finish some frontend components and general code cleanup. We also started revisiting deployment but we're unlucky when it came to getting the apps to build.

April 25, 2023

Today we were able to finish the deployment for our app. As far as I can tell, the app deploys at least our MVP so that was the goal. We also finished our unit tests and got all of them to pass as well for the deployment.

April 26, 2023

Today we mostly worked on the more cosmetic pages for the website. I re-stylized the Navbar and button placement for most components, while the others worked on a likes page and a profile page. We should be good as far as "bare minimum requirements" go for the project, however I still want to polish our app until presentations next week.
