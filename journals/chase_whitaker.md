Today, I worked on the authentication with my team. I pushed what I worked on over the weekend to my authentication-trial branch and Danny helped debug it with John to get the create-account working, once that was done, we were able to create, login and logout. Tonight and tomorrow I will work on other account endpoints like get_one, update_account, and delete_account.

Today we had to revisit the schema and wire frame to talk about implementing a new Like feature. We spent most of the day planning and reworking our ubiquitous language, and planning.

Today we worked as a group to implement the new feature for the backend endpoints. We had to update the arts schema to include a user_id to link the user to the art. We also added a create like feature, a get_all_likes feature, a get_one_like feature, and a delete_like feature. We're hoping tha these are sufficient in covering our backend requirements so we can move on to front end authentication and development.
