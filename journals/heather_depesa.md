## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Monday 3/27/2023:
We're already one week into the project planning. We have our wireframes drawn, our endpoints just about all worked out, and our preliminary schemas planned. I expect we will begin adding issues to our repo tomorrow, and maybe even begin coding.

Tuesday 3/28:
As expected we began creating issues this afternoon. It was harder than I expected, but I'm so glad we're doing it. All sorts of things we didn't think of are coming to light through the process.
In other news: It's really hard to come to aggreements with a team of other students. Nobody 100% knows what they're doing, so it feels like the blind leading the blind sometimes.
I hope we start coding soon, before I completely forget how - lol!

Tuesday 4/4:
My entry for this day got lost in migration.

Wednesday 4/5:
We started the day excited to get into our issues, but ran into a snag. Some of our team cranked out too many endpoints, and so we spent the evening working on ways to solve that dilemma.
