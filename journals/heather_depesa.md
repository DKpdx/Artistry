Monday 3/27/2023:
We're already one week into the project planning. We have our wireframes drawn, our endpoints just about all worked out, and our preliminary schemas planned. I expect we will begin adding issues to our repo tomorrow.

Tuesday 3/28:
We began creating issues this afternoon. It was harder than I expected, but I'm so glad we're doing it. All sorts of things we didn't think of are coming to light through the process.

Tuesday 4/4:
It's been a week since my last entry. We spent most of last week working together on migrations and Auth. Today login, logout were completed. C.R. to accounts got working.
Also today, we went over all the issues as a group, since we had broken off to create them solo..That went well, and I expect we'll divi them up first thing tomorrow and be able to get going on our respective features.

Wednesday 4/5:
We reworked our mvp today to make sure each of us had the requirements to do that we need to pass the project. To do that, we moved liking art to our mvp.

Thursday 4/6:
We worked as a team to figure out the new table we need so Likes can happen.

Friday 4/7:
I began coding the likes backend.

4/10-4/14: Spring break

Monday 4/17:
Most of our worktime today was to begin the deployment process.

Mon 4/17-21
All of my work time this week has been spent on likes. My endpoints are complete, but I am struggling to make my frontend features work into what the team has built. I'm trying to make the little heart function as a like button.
It needs to be tied to the art card it's on so that when it's clicked, it can feed the art_id and the artist's id and the current logged-in user id into our Likes table. There's a lot more to it, but that would be step 1.
Upon realizing that the heart was much more complex than the forms my team had already finished, I ultimately resorted to creating a simple form so a user can like art. The heart is now a stretch goal.

4/24:
Teamwork makes the dream work. We did more work on deployment and tests.

4/25:
Today some of the team helped me work out the last wrinkles in my test and component. A-ha moment was the same as every day.. it's harder to make your pieces fit into an architecture you didn't design.

4/26:
I went to work on the stretch goal that is the Likes component. A user will be able to see all the art they've liked and it will display the same as the landing page does.

4/27:
Today the team had a look at the Likes component I'm working on but we didn't solve the problems it currently has. We made sure everything was tidy and I redrew our wireframe to reflect the project as it is today.
