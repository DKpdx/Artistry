Today created the docker-compose.yaml and then it was pushed to the main. The pipeline failure warning from gitlab had the team confused and we spent some time trying to "fix" the issue. When in reality it was a null problem for us which we realized. Then we tested the docker and after the containers were all running fine it was given the final push.

we worked on auth and trying to get it to work but were unsuccessful.

3/31/23
continued the same auth work and still struggled.

4/4/23
Started from main and rebuilt yaml and other stuff in order to try and go line by line to get auth to work. Compared to what had been done previously and was able to get the create/login/logout to work. Then pushed it to the dk-test-branch so the rest of the team could check if it worked. It was a success!
huge collaboration to make this all happen.
