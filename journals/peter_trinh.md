## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

We were able to overcome blocker that is called authorization. As a team, we were really ecstatic that we're able to move on to other things within our project. We set out deployment on 4/20, so we have more than a week to debug anything. Overall, we're happy that we manage to get past the authorization.

I went ahead and worked on the backend for the arts endpoint, but it messed up everyone. We had to figured out the additional endpoints for the rest of the team to work. We spent most of the day just trying to figured out the endpoints and it felt like we wasted a whole day on it.

Thursday 4/6/2023:
Did peer programing with everyone that's missing their endpoints. I'm fixing with arts api and its database to that each art is assign to a a user and the art displays the art username versus an integer.

Friday 4/7/2023:
I started on the create art form.

4/10-4/17/2023:
