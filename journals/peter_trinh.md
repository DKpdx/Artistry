## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

We were able to overcome blocker that is called authorization. As a team, we were really ecstatic that we're able to move on to other things within our project. We set out deployment on 4/20, so we have more than a week to debug anything. Overall, we're happy that we manage to get past the authorization.

Wednesday 4/5/2023:
I went ahead and worked on the backend for the arts endpoint, but it messed up everyone. We had to figured out the additional endpoints for the rest of the team to work. We spent most of the day just trying to figured out the endpoints and it felt like we wasted a whole day on it.

Thursday 4/6/2023:
Did peer programing with everyone that's missing their endpoints. I'm fixing with arts api and its database to that each art is assign to a a user and the art displays the art username versus an integer.

Friday 4/7/2023:
I started on the create art form.

4/10-4/17/2023:
Dealing with a lost of someone important to me.

Tuesday 4/18/2023:
I was having token authorization issue when it came to creating an art form. Will be spending the today and tomorrow to fix it.

Wednesday 4/19/2023:
Managed to solve the authorization issue on my create art form and managed to get the app to work with tailwind. We're still working on our indvidual issues and doing peer programing for those that need help.

Thursday 4/20/2023:
Worked on an update art form and managed to get it to work. We have a few more components that we need to finish still. I'm going to start working on the art detail page tomorrow.

Monday 4/24/2023:
We're working on our individual unit test and we're also trying to get deployment to work. We're planning to ask an instructor for help with our deployment tomorrow if we can't get it done by tonight. I also didn't work on the art detail page because Danny already had it started on it before i started it.

Tuesday 4/25/2023:
We're still working on trying to finish deployment and hopefully get it done by today. Some of us are still working on our unit test, including me, and I also want to work on our READme. We got deployment done last night which was a huge relieve for us. I also worked on the CSS for the update art form.

Wednesday 4/26/2034:
The team is working on cleaning up the code of commented out code and console.logs. Some of us are working on styling of the webpage, while I'm working on our READme. We start working on stretch goals where we're working on to get a profile page for the user bio and arts and a like page for user likes.
