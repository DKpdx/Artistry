## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

We set out deployment on 4/20, so we have more than a week to debug anything. Overall, we're happy that we manage to get past the authorization.
