## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.
 
 ## 4/4/23 and before
 * We worked as a group to make the migrations and get the Auth working. We have only been working as a group so far, besides people working on their own time to try and figure out the issues.

We decided that we wil be calling one of our pages "Profile" instead of shop, to clearify some ubiquitous language. We are also going to be hard coding in the categories so it will be a drop down.
