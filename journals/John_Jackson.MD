## 4/25/23
Today we finished deployment in the morning then spent the rest of the day working on Heathers component as a team, we also worked on her unit test with her. 
I also cleaned up the our component organization a little bit.

## 4/24/23
Today we worked as a team on on some of the unit test, and we also worked on deployment as a team. 
Our Aha moment was that we needed to merge to the maim branch for the last 2 deployment tests to build 

## 4/20/23
Today I finished the updated form. It's still not updating everything on the front end immediately, but will update after being logged out.
Danny and I peer programed on writing unit test for get all accounts and  get accounts by id. 

## 4/19/23
Today we worked as group on some bug fixes. I got my update account form to work, but we are still getting errors in the console.
Danny was able to get his detail of accounts working.

## 4/18/23
Today we worked on deployment a little bit then we split off and worked on our front end components.
I pair programmed with Danny because we are working on related components, he's working on an account detail page and I am working on the account update page.

## 4/17/23
I was absent, sitting in a car all day

## 4/7/23
Today I unsuccessfully worked on making a unit test. I think there might have been something wrong with the install of pytest, so I tried to start working on my frontend component.

## 4/6/23
Today as a group we worked on the endpoints for the likes feature that Danny finished his endpoint, I finished my endpoint, and we are still working on figuring Heathers out.
Only design discussion was on the schema for the like table, and we decided it would need a user id for the person that made the art, an art id for the artwork itself, a liked by reference to the user that liked the art, and a created at to show the time the like was made to organize the art.
My aha moment was being taught how to change git lab so you can't automatically push to main.

##  4/5/23
Today we had to rework our mvp because we didn't have enough endpoints for everyone to do, so we added one of our stretch goals to the mvp.
We are adding a like feature so that a user can like art work and have the artwork saved to a page they can view it later.
My aha moment was that communication with your team is key.

## 4/4/23 and before
 We worked as a group to make the migrations and get the Auth working. We have only been working as a group so far, besides people working on their own time to try and figure out the issues.
We decided that we wil be calling one of our pages "Profile" instead of shop, to clearify some ubiquitous language. We are also going to be hard coding in the categories so it will be a drop down.
