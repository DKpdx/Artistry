## 4/6/23
Today as a group we worked on the endpoints for the likes feature that Danny finished his endpoint, I finished my endpoint, and we are still working on figuring Heathers out.

Only design discussion was on the schema for the like table, and we dicided it would need a user id for the person that made the art, an art id for the artwork itself, a liked by refrence to the user that liked the art, and a created at to show the time the like was made to organize the art.

My aha moment was being taught how to change git lab so you can't automatically push to main.

##  4/5/23
Today we had to rework our mvp because we didn't have enough endpoints for everyone to do, so we added one of our stretch goals to the mvp.

We are adding a like feature so that a user can like art work and have the artwork saved to a page they can view it later.

My aha moment was that communication with your team is key.


## 4/4/23 and before
 We worked as a group to make the migrations and get the Auth working. We have only been working as a group so far, besides people working on their own time to try and figure out the issues.

We decided that we wil be calling one of our pages "Profile" instead of shop, to clearify some ubiquitous language. We are also going to be hard coding in the categories so it will be a drop down.
